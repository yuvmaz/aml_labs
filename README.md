# Azure Machine Learning Technical Labs

This repository contains a number of labs to showcase the capabilites of Azure Machine Learning.  The current labs are:

1.  Fine-tune a Llama 3 model with LORA, using a T4 GPU as a developer.
2.  Same as lab 1, this time with 4 x A100 GPUs as an AML job.
3.  Fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment analysis.
